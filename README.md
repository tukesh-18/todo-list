Overview

This project is a simple web-based to-do list application built using JavaScript. It provides essential features for managing tasks efficiently.
Features

    Task Creation: Users can add new tasks by entering text and pressing Enter.
    Task Completion: Tasks can be marked as completed or uncompleted individually using checkboxes.
    Task Deletion: Individual tasks can be deleted.
    Task Filtering: Tasks can be filtered based on completion status (all, completed, uncompleted).
    Task Counting: Displays the total number of tasks, completed tasks, and uncompleted tasks.
    Bulk Actions: Clear all or complete all tasks with a single click.

Structure

The application is structured using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

    HTML: Creates the basic structure of the to-do list, including input fields, buttons, and the task list.
    CSS: Styles the application's appearance and layout.
    JavaScript: Handles the application's logic, including task creation, deletion, completion, filtering, and counting.

How It Works

    DOM Manipulation: The JavaScript code fetches necessary elements from the HTML document using their IDs.
    Task Creation: When a user enters text and presses Enter, a new list item is created and appended to the task list.
    Task Completion: Checkboxes are used to mark tasks as completed or uncompleted. The number of completed and uncompleted tasks is updated accordingly.
    Task Deletion: A delete button is associated with each task. Clicking the button removes the corresponding list item.
    Task Filtering: Buttons allow users to filter tasks based on completion status.
    Task Counting: The number of total tasks, completed tasks, and uncompleted tasks is displayed.
    Bulk Actions: Buttons for clearing all tasks and completing all tasks are provided.
